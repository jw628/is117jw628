            Wow, This is my first paragraph! There are so many words to be spoke. Wait, this is a paragraph, therefore
            the words are written. WAIT, this is on a computer so they are typed. WAIT, this is on a keyboard so they
            are tapped or pressed. Ok this is enough writing now.
        </p>

            Look this is my second paragraph. I have so many words here because it is a paragraph of writing. These
            sentences are made up of words which happen to be made up of letters. This crazy phenomenon is called
            sentence structure. Ok I think this is enough words.
